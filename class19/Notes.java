		//Constructors: is a special block of code. similar to a method that is executed when we create an object of a class.
		
		//The purpose of constructors is to initialize our fields.
		
		//They must have the same name as the name of the class
		
		//Constructors do not have return types, not even void.
		
		//We can pass arguments to our constructors, just like we do for our methods 
		
		
		//Similarities between constructors and methods
		
		//1. Both can have parameters
		//2. Both can have access modifiers like private pubic and protected/defaut
		
		//1.Constructor must have the same name as it's class but Methods can have any arbitrary name in Java.
		//2. Constructor doesn't have any return type, not even declared as void but method has the return type and also declared as void.
		//3. In java, keyword this and super is used to call a constructor explicitly. But method is called by their own name.
		//4.  Constructor can not be inherited by child classes but Methods can be inherited by child classes.
		//5. Constructors are automatically called when an instance of the class is created.
		
		//When should we use constructors?
		
		//When we want to control the initialization for our fields.
