	 * Three ways to store the date using java
	 * 
	 * 1. Variables: We can store only one value
	 * 
	 * 2.Arrays: they can store multiple objects; but hey are fixed in size
	 * 
	 * 3. Collection: Can also store multiple objects and they are dynamic, can grow and shrink
	 * the size at runtime. We can't use primitives with collections. Collections can be used with objects 
	 * only.
	 * 
	 * Wrapper Classes: are classes from java to help use collections with our primitives
	 * types as they are objects. They also have many built-in methods to manipulate the
	 * data types for example converting a string to an Integer. 
	 * 
	 * Ex:
	 * 
	 * String number="10"
	 * int num=Integer.parseInt(number)
	 * 
	 *Iterator: is an interface that lets us iterate through any collection. It has three methods;
	 *hasNext() :checks if there are any elements left in the collection
	 *next() :checks if there are any elements from the collection
	 *remove(). : remove method it will remove the element from the colection
	 *
	 *All of the collection classes they have a method interator()
	 *using this method I can get an object of the iterator and then call the above three methods
	 *to interate or remove the elements
	 *
